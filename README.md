Task 3:Tic-Tac-Toe web application
As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application.The game supports both Human vs Human and Human vs Computer modes, with features such as player name input, turn tracking, and a live scoreboard. It includes clear instructions, restart functionality, and is designed with a clean green-themed interface for a smooth user experience.
